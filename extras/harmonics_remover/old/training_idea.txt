	- Get large MIDI dataset
	
	PRE-PROCESS:
	
		- Filter drums out of all MIDI recordings
		- Remove all notes above or below GDFT range
		- Render all MIDI to mono WAV @ 12800Hz
		- Chunk WAV files into spectral frames
		- Delete 90% randomly
		- Feed into C++ spectral frame generator
		- Convert output to float[64] arrays associated with float[64] arrays of input notes
	
	TRAIN:
	
		- Goal: network gets real music in, and returns DFT without harmonics
		- Network takes real GDFT in with 1:1 MIDI notes as an expected output
		
	DEPLOY:
	
		- Export final weights/biases to float arrays for ESP-DSP
